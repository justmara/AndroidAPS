    <string name="description_sensitivity_aaps">Sensitivity is calculated the same way like Oref0, but you can specify timeframe to the past. Minimal carb absorption is calculated from max carb absorption time from preferences.</string>
    <string name="description_sensitivity_oref1">Sensitivity is calculated from 8h or 24h data in the past (using either which is more sensitive). Carbs (if not absorbed) are cut after time specified in preferences. Plugin also calculates UAM.</string>
    <string name="description_sensitivity_weighted_average">Sensitivity is calculated as a weighted average from deviations. Newer deviations have higher weight. Minimal carb absorption is calculated from max carb absorption time from preferences. This algorithm is the fastest in following sensitivity changes.</string>
